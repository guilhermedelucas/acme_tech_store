To run the ACME tech store I'm presuming you have npm and node installed in your computer:

1 - Type npm install inside the app folder;
2 - After instalation complete, type node index.js;
3 - Now on the browser type localhost:8080;
4 - To execute the test just type npm test inside the app's folder;
